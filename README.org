* A naive theme for my so-call publish essays

** Problem: Want to write and publish my essays in Emacs

*** But I feel frustration when look at other already open-source solution.

*** So I built my own solution. Hope that it will work out-of-the-box

The design and idea base on Edward Tufte design.
